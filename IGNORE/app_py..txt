1. Get request is to load the data in
2.Post request is when you are taking data from user input and sending it to another destination
or sending it to some endpoint.
3. LINE 14: if "file" not in request.files:
            return redirect(request.url)
	This means if a valid file is not found then we will redirect the user to the same page.
4.LINE 21: if file:
            recognizer = sr.Recognizer()
            audioFile = sr.AudioFile(file)
            with audioFile as source:
                data = recognizer.record(source)
            transcript = recognizer.recognize_google(data, key=None)
We have taken the file that user uploaded, created an audio file object that our speech recognization module
can understand and then next we are opening up this audio file  and reading it in through the recognizer 
And so once we have this data in a format that our speech recognition module can recognize , our goal
now is to simply apply a speech reognition technique.
And in the LINE 26 we use google cloud to convert audio file into text.

Main code is from LINE 21 to LINE 26:
